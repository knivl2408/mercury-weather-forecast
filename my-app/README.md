## Difficulties

## ------------

1. It was a first time, when I worked with Typescript
2. I couldn't set Eslint, so I used just plugin Prettier on global level
3. The method map() doesn't work how in simple React project with native js, so I have a lot of rows of code because of that
4. In TS I can't use js code in HTML wit {} or <script>, sometimes it was hard

## ------------

## Doubts

## ------------

1. I think that the custom 'select' can be made another way

## ------------

## What I didn't have time to do

## ------------

1. I had got not all day for this task. I didn't do "Forecast for a Date in the Past"
2. Make custom 'select' more universal
3. Make universal modal for 7 cards with weather without map()

## Something else

## ------------

-   The layout is very colourful and interesting, it was cool to do it. Thanks Vlada Belopolskaya for answers to my questions:)
-   I wrote README in English because your website, links and layout in eng and in the Net people say to write in English
    Thank you for watching
